    <meta name="description" content="AllSpark Chain is a public blockchain where content creators, advertisers and social media users co-exist in a reciprocal sharing economy. Within its blockchain ecosystem, the AllSpark Token (ASK) serves as a value consensus for all contents created across all centralized and decentralized platforms. Users earn tangible rewards that are directly correlated to their contributions. Advertisers work directly with content creators, and content consumers and sharers can receive dividends for their participation in the spreading of valuable content.">
